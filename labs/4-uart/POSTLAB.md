## UART: Redux

#### Student Perspective

I remember being in the middle of this lab, and having an a-ha moment as I 
realized just how useful the pre-reading and questions to check my understanding
actually were. Coming into lab with at some level of understanding for what needed
to be translated into code was a great way to jumpstart the lab. I also noticed
a big difference between this lab and `gpio`; having just a single
lab's worth of exposure to the Broadcom doc under my belt made this lab feel
like I was really getting my feet under me. Also, the challenge of writing a device's
`_init` function was an exciting step forward.

#### Key Points from the Lab

##### 1. Importance of memory barriers (e.g. `dev_barrier()`)


##### 2. The "read-modify-write" pattern



##### 3. Common errors and misconceptions
    - "hellhellhellhell..." output: While `1-uart/hello`
